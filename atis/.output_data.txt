 great now what i want to find out is on mn# dn# from ci# to ci# do you have a flight least expensive fare around dn# o'clock in the morning 	( argmin $0 ( and ( flight $0 ) ( approx_departure_time $0 ti0 ) ( from $0 ci0 ) ( to $0 ci1 ) ( day_number $0 dn0 ) ( month $0 mn0 ) ) ( fare $0 ) )
 again i will repeat i want to make a one way flight from ci# to ci# will you tell me how much the fares are i would like the cheapest fare 	( min $0 ( exists $1 ( and ( flight $1 ) ( oneway $1 ) ( from $1 ci0 ) ( to $1 ci1 ) ( = ( fare $1 ) $0 ) ) ) )
 round trip fares from ci# to ci# less than do# dollars 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( and ( flight $1 ) ( round_trip $1 ) ( or ( and ( < ( fare $1 ) do0 ) ( from $1 ci2 ) ( to $1 ci1 ) ) ( and ( < ( fare $1 ) do0 ) ( from $1 ci3 ) ( to $1 ci1 ) ) ( and ( < ( fare $1 ) do0 ) ( from $1 ci0 ) ( to $1 ci1 ) ) ) ( = ( fare $1 ) $0 ) ) ) )
 i would like to find a flight that goes from ci# to ci# i would like it to have a stop in ci# and i would like a flight that serves me# 	( lambda $0 e ( and ( flight $0 ) ( meal $0 breakfast:me ) ( from $0 ci1 ) ( to $0 ci2 ) ( stop $0 ci0 ) ) )
 i would like to find a flight from ci# to ci# on al# and arriving at about dn# o'clock in the evening could you please tell me the aircraft and the flight number thank you 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( exists $2 ( and ( flight $2 ) ( airline $2 al0 ) ( approx_arrival_time $2 ti0 ) ( from $2 ci1 ) ( to $2 ci0 ) ( = ( aircraft_code $2 ) $0 ) ( = ( flight_number $2 ) $1 ) ) ) ) )
 what flights can i take between ci# and ci# so that when i leave ci# i will have the maximum amount of time on the ground in ci# and still return in the same day 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( and ( equals $0 ( argmin $2 ( and ( flight $2 ) ( from $0 ci0 ) ( to $0 ci1 ) ) ( arrival_time $2 ) ) ) ( equals $1 ( argmax $2 ( and ( flight $2 ) ( to $0 ci0 ) ( from $0 ci1 ) ) ( departure_time $2 ) ) ) ) ) )
 what flights do you have between ci# and ci# 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( and ( flight $1 ) ( airline $1 al0 ) ( < ( departure_time $1 ) ti0 ) ( from $1 ci1 ) ( to $1 ci0 ) ( = ( aircraft_code $1 ) $0 ) ) ) )
 all right would you let me know type of aircraft al#  is using on the flights from ci# to ci# i would like to know the type of aircraft that they use on these flights before dn# in the morning 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( and ( flight $1 ) ( airline $1 al0 ) ( class_type $1 first:cl ) ( from $1 ci1 ) ( to $1 ci0 ) ( stop $1 ci2 ) ( = ( aircraft_code $1 ) $0 ) ) ) )
 i'm going to leave ci# and i want to go to ci# and i want to fly dn# class american and i want a stop in ci# can you please tell me what type of aircraft you will be flying 	( lambda $0 e ( exists $1 ( and ( flight $1 ) ( round_trip $1 ) ( approx_arrival_time $1 ti0 ) ( from $1 ci0 ) ( to $1 ci1 ) ( day $1 da0 ) ( month $1 mn0 ) ( day_number $1 dn0 ) ( = ( airline:e $1 ) $0 ) ) ) )
