# Semantic-Parsing-Data-Pre-Processing
Data Pre-Processing for ATIS, jobs640, overnight
  This is a project for Data pre-processing for ATIS, jobs640 and overnight for these data sets to be used with a pre-trained
embedding layer. 
  Please find following papers helpful to understand this project better:
  1) Dong, L., & Lapata, M. (2018). Coarse-to-fine decoding for neural semantic parsing
  2) Dong, L., & Lapata, M. (2016). Language to logical form with neural attention
  
  The target for this project is to help train a semantic parsing model that matches natural language to its logical form
